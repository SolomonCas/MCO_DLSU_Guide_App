# MCO_DLSU_Guide_App

This is an academic machine project for mobile development.  We have created a De La Salle University (DLSU) guide map to help people navigate the campus.
The challenge of this project is to develop a map application dedicated to DLSU students.  We developed the app using Mapbox as our map view and other map functionalities and Firebase as our database.

## Setup
- The application needs a Mapbox secret key in the `grade.properties`. Here is the link to follow the installation of Mapbox (https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/install/)
- The application needs a `google-services.json` for the Firebase. Here is the link to follow how to setup Firebase (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbHfJpoOzkI&t=569s)

## Functionalities of the App
- Register
- Login
- Add Marker (Hold press the map)
- Edit Marker:
  1. Press the Marker (the marker is draggable)
  2. Press the Marker again (you can change the fields of the marker)
- Rate and review
